# Jiujitsu-ELO

In this project, I...
1) Develop R code for fitting a penalized conditional logistic regression model
2) Apply this model to Brazilian Jiujitsu (BJJ) competition data (through 2016) to identify rankings for competitors

The algorithm for fitting the penalized conditional logistic regression model maximizes the penalized log-likelihood (a ridge penalty is included). This maximization is done via gradient ascent. The code includes components written in R and C++
